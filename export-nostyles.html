			<p class="BodyText_BentonSansBook_12-21">The ocean is filled with countless beautiful wonders, but did you know that strange creatures also live in its darkness? Some are highly poisonous, and a few behave oddly. Others look like they belong in a hor<span class="NoBreak">ror movie!</span></p>
			<p class="Subhead_BentonSansMedium_12-21">The Box<span class="NoBreak"> Jellyfish</span></p>
			<p class="BodyText_BentonSansBook_12-21">One of the deadliest sea monsters is the box jellyfish. It lives in parts of the Indian and Pacific oceans. It has long, thin parts around its mouth. These parts carry a powerful sting that helps to protect the jellyfish from enemies, or <span class="GlossaryWord_Bold">predators</span>. Because these jellyfish are nearly see-through, divers must remain alert to av<span class="NoBreak">oid them. </span></p>
			<p class="Subhead_BentonSansMedium_12-21">The Colo<span class="NoBreak">ssal Squid</span></p>
			<p class="BodyText_BentonSansBook_12-21">The word colossal means “huge.” However, the colossal squid is not the biggest animal in the ocean. That title goes to the blue whale, the largest animal to have ever lived on Earth. But the squid is still big—each of its eyes is the size of a soccer ball. It also has eight arms and string-like parts it uses to catch fish and drag them to i<span class="NoBreak">ts mouth. </span></p>
			<p class="BodyText_BentonSansBook_12-21">The colossal squid lives more than a mile beneath icy waters near Antarctica. It is seldom seen. In fact, for centuries, people thought the animal might be a <span class="GlossaryWord_Bold">legend</span>, or story. Then one was caught<span class="NoBreak"> in 2007. </span><br />The captured squid was thirty f<span class="NoBreak">eet long! </span></p>
			<p class="Subhead_BentonSansMedium_12-21">Gobli<span class="NoBreak">n Sharks  </span></p>
			<p class="BodyText_BentonSansBook_12-21">One of the oldest fish in the ocean is the goblin shark. It has been around for over 100 mill<span class="NoBreak">ion years.</span></p>
			<p class="BodyText_BentonSansBook_12-21">It’s easy to see how the goblin got its name. It hunts in the deep sea for food, or <span class="GlossaryWord_Bold">prey</span>. To grab its prey, the shark’s jaw and fifty sharp teeth shoot forward from its mouth! It looks like something from a <span class="NoBreak">nightmare.</span></p>
